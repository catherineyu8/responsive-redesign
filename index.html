			<h2>Original Design</h2>
			<div id="pick-webpage">
				<p>
					Despite containing relatively simple content, the
					<a href="https://www.torontocupcake.com/index.html"
						>Toronto Cupcake</a
					>
					website is extremely frustrating to navigate through and has
					visually inconsistent, cluttered pages. Its poor design and
					lack of clear organization makes it difficult for users to
					quickly find the information they need, potentially driving
					away customers who might otherwise place an order.

				<p>
					I chose to specifically redesign the
					<a href="https://www.torontocupcake.com/faqs.html">FAQs</a>
					page because, despite its simple and straightforward
					purpose, its layout makes it hard for users to efficiently
					find the information they need.
				</p>

			<div id="find-problems">
				<h2>Identifying Problems</h2>
				<p>
					I analyzed the usability of the FAQs page according to
					several different criteria:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong style="color: #c22c5d">Efficiency</strong> - is
						it fast to do typical tasks? (for frequent users)
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong style="color: #c22c5d">Learnability</strong> -
						is it easy to learn? (for new users)
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong style="color: #c22c5d">Memorability</strong> -
						is it easy to remember what to do? (for casual users)
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong style="color: #c22c5d">Conceptual model</strong>
						- how does the interface reveal to the user how it
						works? (using visual/physical/audio cues)
					</li>
				</ul>
				<table>
					<col style="width: 30%" />
					<col style="width: 24%" />
					<col style="width: 22%" />
					<col style="width: 24%" />
					<tr>
						<th>Efficiency</th>
						<th>Learnability</th>
						<th>Memorability</th>
						<th>Conceptual model</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Answers don't automatically collapse -
									creates a cluttered page when multiple Q/A's
									are displayed, making it harder/less
									efficient to read through the Q/A the user
									actually wants
								</li>
								<li>
									Organization using both rows and columns
									makes the users' visual path zig-zagged -
									less efficient and harder to skim for the
									Q/A they are looking for
								</li>
								<li>
									Responsiveness of the nav dropdown makes it
									hard for users to navigate to the right
									section (expandable 'cupcakes' tab has no
									delay when mousing-over)
								</li>
								<li>
									On longer pages, nav dropdown disappears
									from the screen and the user has to scroll
									all the way up to access it again
								</li>
							</ul>
						</td>
						<td>
							<ul>
								<li>
									FAQ buttons don't look clickable - new users
									may not know to click on them to
									expand/collapse the answer
								</li>
								<li>
									Organization using both rows and columns
									makes the users' visual path zig-zagged,
									which is unintuitive when a new user is
									trying to find a question
								</li>
							</ul>

									Once a user experiments with how to click
									through the website the first time, it is

									experience

					<h3>Accessibility</h3>
					<p>
						Not only is the Toronto Cupcake website poorly designed
						in terms of
						<strong style="color: #c22c5d">efficacy</strong>, but it
						also raises concerns about
						<strong style="color: #c22c5d">accessibility</strong>. I
						used the
						<a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WebAIM WAVE</a> tool
						to evaluate the accessibility of the FAQs page, and it
						found
						<strong style="color: #c22c5d"
							>19 “very low contrast” errors</strong
						>
						in the dropdown and footer menus. The colors used for
						these menus is a dark gray and medium pink, which is not
						only an aesthetically poor choice in color scheme, but
						the contrast between colors is also hard to distinguish,
						especially for colorblind users. Luckily, the Toronto
						Cupcake website provides a
						<strong style="color: #c22c5d"
							>high contrast mode</strong
						>
						that increases the contrast between colors on the page,
						however the problem remains that the colors chosen are
						not visually appealing, especially on high contrast mode
						when the color scheme becomes somewhat inconsistent.
					</p>
					<p>
						Here are some screenshots of the problematic components:

			<h2>Redesigning the Webpage</h2>
			<div id="design-choices">
				<h3>Design Choices</h3>
				<p>
					Main changes I made in my redesign (from the original
					webpage) and their impact on usability include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong style="color: #c22c5d">Reformat FAQs</strong> in
						a single column, grouped by section headings — allows
						users to efficiently read straight down the page to find
						what they are looking for
					</li>
					<li>
						Added an
						<strong style="color: #c22c5d"
							>expandable carrot</strong
						>
						icon that flips when expanded/hidden — shows users that
						there is a button that can be clicked to show hidden
						information
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong style="color: #c22c5d">Pinned navbar</strong> —
						allows users to always have easy access the main
						navigation tabs
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<p>
					I also made the following adjustments to my redesign after
					feedback from a peer
					<strong style="color: #c22c5d">critique</strong>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Removed 'faqs' tab from navbar</li>
					<li>
						Removed 'about' tab from footer, switched order of
						footer tabs
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<br />

			<div id="mockups">
				<h3>Mockups</h3>
				<p>
					To ensure consistency in my redesign, I first created a
					<strong style="color: #c22c5d">visual style guide</strong>
					including a color palette, typography, and reusable
					interactive components.
				</p>
				<p>
					Using this guide, I then made three mockup redesigns for the
					Toronto Cupcake FAQs page: 1 each for mobile, tablet, and
					desktop versions.
				</p>

				<div class="columns">
					<div class="column mobile">
						<h3>Mobile</h3>
						<img src="./images/mockups/mobile.png" />
					</div>
					<div class="column tablet">
						<h3>Tablet</h3>
						<img src="./images/mockups/tablet.png" />
					</div>
					<div class="column desktop">
						<h3>Desktop</h3>
						<img src="./images/mockups/desktop.png" />
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					To view the full interactive versions of these mockups, as
					well as annotations on the responsive layout elements, see
					my full

						>Figma project</a
					>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<br />

			<h2>Final Redesign</h2>
			<p>
				Finally, I implemented these redesigned mockup pages using HTML
				and CSS. My redesigned webpage is responsive to different screen
				sizes, and you can view my interactive final redesigned FAQs
				page

		<div id="takeaways">
			<h2>Takeaways</h2>

			<p>
				One of my biggest takeaways from redesigning the Toronto Cupcake
				FAQs page was the importance of clear
				<strong style="color: #c22c5d"
					>organization and hierarchy</strong
				>
				in design. The original page's layout made it difficult to
				navigate, so restructuring the FAQ content into a single-column
				format with distinct section headings significantly improved
				readability.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, I learned to both create
				<strong style="color: #c22c5d"
					>responsive, reusable components</strong
				>
				in Figma, and implement these using HTML and CSS. Designing the
				components that automatically adapted formatting across
				different screen sizes largely improved the reusability of my
				design, allowing me to spend less time formatting for individual
				screens.
			</p>
			<p>
				Overall, this redesign project gave me insight into the process
				of analyzing website usability and redesigning webpages to
				better enhance functionality and user experience.
